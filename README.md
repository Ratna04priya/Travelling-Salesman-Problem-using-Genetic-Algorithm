_Travelling Salesman Problem Using Genetic Algorithm_
Finding a solution to the travelling salesman problem requires we set up a genetic algorithm in a specialized way. For instance, a valid solution would need to represent a route where every location is included at least once and only once. If a route contain a single location more than once, or missed a location out completely it wouldn't be valid and we would be valuable computation time calculating it's distance.
