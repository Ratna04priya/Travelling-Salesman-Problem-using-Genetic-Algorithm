_Travelling Salesman Problem Using Genetic Algorithm_.


A solution to the travelling salesman problem requires we set up a genetic algorithm in a specialized way. For instance, a valid solution would need to represent a route where every location is included at least once and only once. If a route contain a single location more than once, or missed a location out completely it wouldn't be valid and we would be valuable computation time calculating it's distance.

## Travelling Salesman Problem

Travelling Salesman Problem is a situation in which a salesman is allowed to travel n number of cities, with the following conditions-

    1. Salesman has to visit each city only once.
    2. Salesman has to finish at the city he has started.

The possible paths between any 2 cities is (N-1).
